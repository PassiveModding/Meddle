This project is a Dalamud plugin which provides a GUI for exporting player models from FFXIV.

- Much of this code if from [Penumbra](https://github.com/xivdev/Penumbra) and [Xande](https://github.com/xivdev/Xande) and would not have been possible without the contributions of the authors of those projects.
- This is very much a work in progress, and is not yet fully functional.
- There is no guarantee that memory safety is maintained, and it is possible that this plugin could crash your game.

For single model export, use Penumbra. This plugin is intended for exporting multiple meshes at once, such as for a full character model.
